Currently a twenty-something year old consultant in the computer security industry with a passion for all things tech and finance.

The goal here is to host information that was deemed valuable at different points in time ranging across the afore mentioned sectors. I will do my best to categorize and tag posts appropriately so as to make it easier to find what you need. In general most reference files or code will be hosted on my GitHub through gists making in freely accessible and detached from this blog should the page ever disappear, hence still permitting access to the code.

In general most posts will not follow a particular structure except to accomplish the goal of delivering clear and concise content.

You can find me on LinkedIn and/or GitHub via the URLs on the side bar.
